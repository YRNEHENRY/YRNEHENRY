## Who am I ?
👋 Hi, I’m Henry, a Belgian programmer 🇧🇪👨🏼‍💻 who's currently studying data intelligence as well as web & mobile development. I’m interested in web development 👀 and also like statistics and machine learning.

My range of programming skills are : Javascript, PHP, Python, Java, C and C#. I learn swift in my spare time.

I mostly use my spare time to work on my projects to not fall apart in class 😅. I also enjoy reading 📖, doing sports 🏊🏻‍♂️ and cooking 🧑🏼‍🍳. Otherwise like everyone else I like to waste my time on crap like animes and video games.

## The purpose of my GitHub 
This GitHub is there for my study and personal projects.
