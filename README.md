## Who am I ?
👋 Hi, I’m Henry, a Belgian programmer 🇧🇪👨🏼‍💻 who's currently studying data intelligence as well as web & mobile development. I’m interested in statistics and machine learning.

I'm a Python and C developper.
But my range of programming skills also are: C#, Java and Javascript.

I mostly use my spare time to work on my projects to not fall apart in class 😅. I also enjoy reading 📖 and playing chess♟️. 

## The purpose of my GitHub 
This GitHub is there for my study and personal projects.
