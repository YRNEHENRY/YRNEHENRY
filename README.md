## Who am I ?
👋 Hi, I’m Henry, a Belgian programmer 🇧🇪👨🏼‍💻 who's currently studying data intelligence as well as web & mobile development. I’m interested in web development 👀 and also like AI.

My range of programming skills are : Javascript and PHP, Python, Java, C and C#. And also NoSQL et SQL lite.

I mostly use my spare time to work on my projects to not fall apart in class. I also enjoy reading 📖 and doing sports 🏊🏻‍♂️. Otherwise like everyone else I like to waste my time on crap like animes and video games.

## The purpose of my GitHub 
This GitHub is there for my study and personal projects.
